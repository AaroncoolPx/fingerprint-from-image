# fingerprint-from-image
This project extracts fingerprints from an image using OpenCV. The program detects 4 fingers and processes each one to extract its unique fingerprint. Written in Python using Numpy, it can be executed from the command line by passing the image path. The extracted fingerprints are displayed on the screen. Open-source &amp; welcomes contributions.
